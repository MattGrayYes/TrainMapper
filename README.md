# Train Mapper
This takes a UK National Rail service UID and generates a URL for signal.eu.org, with the train's calling points as waypoints on the map.

This is still a first proof of concept that I'm playing with. Don't expect it to work amazingly well.

## Known Issues
* If theres at least one location in the route without a CRS, it'll crash.
* I'm just using CRS locations from OSM, which is generally in the middle of the station. Therefore it doesnt know which platform it's on etc, so signal.eu.org may misinterpret it a bit.
    * For example: Kings Cross' lat/lon is directly above the Piccadilly line. So it routes you out of KGX along the Piccadilly Line to Gunnersbury, along the Suffragette Line, and then onto the ECML.

## Use
### Requirements
* [Deno](https://deno.com/)
* [RealTimeTrains API](https://api.rtt.io/) key.

### Running It
1. Run `deno task web`
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/

### CLI version
1. Change `serviceUid` and `serviceDate` in main.ts to match your train.
    * Search for a train on https://www.realtimetrains.co.uk, and copy the UID from the URL.
1. Run `deno task dev`
